# Room Night Tokenization
The room night tokenization is a system that uses the Ethereum ERC721 protocol to realize roomnight-chaining and tokenized it as a tradable Token. Vendors can use this system to complete the chaining of the hotel's rate plan and manage the inventory and price on the chain. Customers can purchase the room night to generate a digital room night Token. The Token is generated and transferred to customer's account after the transaction is completed. The generated Token can be arbitrarily transferred between customers. Customer holding a Token can complete the Token's consumption (check in) at the corresponding hotel, or they can negotiate with the hotel to destroy the Token and return the purchase funds.
